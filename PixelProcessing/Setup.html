  <h2>Open Processing</h2>
  <p>Open <strong>Processing</strong> from <strong>Start Menu > All Programs > Processing</strong></p>
  <p>By now, you should have already created a repository on Github and cloned it into the local file system. If you haven't, be sure to complete <a href="../Git/Create.html">these steps</a>.</p>
  <h2>Save Processing</h2>
  <p><strong>File > Save As</strong></p>
  <p>Navigate to where your local Github project was cloned, and save this blank sketch as <strong>PixelProcessing</strong>. Your file system should now look like this:</p>
  <img src="../img/pp-explorer-01.png" />
  <p>Inside the PixelProcessing folder should look like this:</p>
  <img src="../img/pp-explorer-02.png" />
  <h2>Our First Image</h2>
  <p>To get everyone on the same page, let's start with the same image. This is Saint Ignatius working at his desk.</p>
  <img src="../img/ignatius.jpg" />
  <p>To do so, simply drag the image from this web page and drop it on top of your Processing sketch.</p>
  <p>Notice your file system has changed. A <strong>data</strong> folder was created...</p>
  <img src="../img/pp-explorer-03.png" />
  <p>... and in it there is now this ignatius.jpg:</p>
  <img src="../img/pp-explorer-04.png" />
  <p>Next, we turn our focus to pixels. This particular image is 444 pixels wide and 377 pixels high, totaling 444 x 377 = 167,388 total pixels.</p>
  <p>Let's write some code that uses this image.</p>
