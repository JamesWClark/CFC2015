  <p>Next, we start adding project files. For example, you can continue working on the GameController class. Open Processing. Go to File > Save As. Name your project GameController and save it in the same location as your Git repository (on the H: drive). Your directory should now look like this.</p>
  <img src="../img/project-directory.png" />
  <p>Switch to Git Bash. Stage your files, preparing them for commit to Github.</p>
  <p><code>git add *</code></p>
  <p>Commit the changes you've made. Add custom messages after the <code>-m</code> such as "initial commit".</p>
  <p><code>git commit -m "initial commit"</code></p>
  <p>Finally, push the changes to Github.</p>
  <p><code>git push origin master</code></p>
  <p>Enter your username and password for Github. Verify the change is live on Github.com.</p>
  <p>Now, when we work on another computer or at a different location (such as home), we can continue these steps to make changes to our code projects.</p>
