  <p>The ultimate goal here is to build a game like Space Invaders. We won&#39;t create an exact copy but we will approach the concept. Before we can build a game like this, we must first develop a clear set of objectives. Here is a list of tasks we need to accomplish in code in order to make this game run:</p>
