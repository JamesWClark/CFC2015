  <p>The ultimate goal here is to build a game like Space Invaders. We won&#39;t create an exact copy but we will approach the concept. Before we can build a game like this, we must first develop a clear set of objectives. Here is a list of tasks we need to accomplish in code in order to make this game run:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create game graphics</li>
    <li>Interact with inputs (keyboard &amp; mouse)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Let's get started...</p>
