    <p>Since this is a game we'll need a few objects to move around the screen. In the very least, we need a player controlled ship, the enemy ship, and a projectile to fire back and forth. It's easy to imagine and in fact here are three such examples:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <img style="width: auto;" src="../img/player.png" />
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <img style="width: auto;" src="../img/enemy.png" />
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <img style="width: auto;" src="../img/bullet.png" />
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p>Although it's very easy to think of the shape, drawing it in a 2D coordinate system using the Processing language requires some consideration.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-3">
      <img src="../img/pshape-step1.png" />
      <p>First, recall the y-axis is upside down compared to what we typically learn in school so the number line goes from negative numbers up top to positive numbers down below.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">
      <img src="../img/pshape-step2.png" />
      <p>We can think of the first shape as a chassis, the structural form to which we attach other shapes. In this case, we can simply create an ellipse.</p>
      <code>ELLIPSE, -90, -40, 180, 80</code>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">
      <img src="../img/pshape-step3.png" />
      <p>This is an arc drawn on top of the ellipse.</p>
      <code>ARC, -50, -15, 100, 30, 0, PI</code>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">
      <img src="../img/pshape-step4.png" />
      <p>This is another arc drawn on top of the ellipse.</p>
      <code>ARC, -50, -50, 100, 100, PI, TWO_PI</code>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <br />
    <p>Putting it all together, we can formulate a method to draw our concept:</p>
    <code><pre>void buildEnemyTwo() {
    enemyTwo = createShape(GROUP);
    fill(115,20,240); //purple
    PShape chassis = createShape(ELLIPSE, -90, -40, 180, 80);
    fill(20,200,255); //light blue
    PShape dome1 = createShape(ARC, -50, -15, 100, 30, 0, PI);
    PShape dome2 = createShape(ARC, -50, -50, 100, 100, PI, TWO_PI);
    enemyTwo.addChild(chassis);
    enemyTwo.addChild(dome1);
    enemyTwo.addChild(dome2);
    enemyTwo.scale(.3);
}</pre></code>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p>We previously discussed Unified Modeling Language (UML) and took a look at a rough sketch I had drawn. Refined, this is the UML class diagram for a ShapeFactory class I proposed last week. This diagram is basically an outline of the code we want to write.</p>
    <p><img src="../img/ShapeFactory.png" /></p>
    <p>Given this diagram, we can easily generate the following code to match it:</p>
    <code><pre>class ShapeFactory {
  
  PShape basicBullet;
  PShape basicPlayer;
  PShape basicEnemy;
  
  //the constructor - very important!
  ShapeFactory() {
    buildBasicBullet();
    buildBasicPlayer();
    buildBasicEnemy();
  }
  
  PShape getBasicBullet() { return basicBullet; }
  PShape getBasicPlayer() { return basicPlayer; }
  PShape getBasicEnemy()  { return basicEnemy; }
  
  void buildBasicBullet() {
      //your code goes here
  }
  
  void buildBasicPlayer() {
      //your code goes here
  }
  
  void buildBasicEnemy() {
      //your code goes here
  }
}</pre></code>
    <p>The code you've already written to create your shapes should be inserted in the <code>//your code goes here</code> sections. When we finish the ShapeFactory class, we can instantiate it in our code like <code>ShapeFactory factory = new ShapeFactory();</code>. In fact, we'll do that next in our GameController class.</p>
